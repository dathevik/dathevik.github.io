**Barev!** 

Welcome to my room! I’m an Armenian astrophysicist based in Santiago, Chile, currently pursuing a PhD at the Instituto de Estudios Astrofísicos, Universidad Diego Portales. My research focuses on high-redshift Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. I study how these distant supermassive black holes influence their surroundings—do they help galaxies grow, or do they shut down star formation? 

Before moving to Chile, I earned my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at Yerevan State University. I have also worked in education as a certified physics content creator and methodological trainer for Armenia’s Ministry of Education and am a co-author of an Armenian methodological book for teachers in inclusive education.

I have always worked on improving the methods of self-learning, constantly reflecting on how I study and refining my approach. As a PhD student, my best allies are to-do lists and note-taking; I write down everything, archive it, and make sense of the chaos later. I plan to share some of these approaches here, so don’t wander too far!

My scientific interests cover galaxy formation and evolution, multiwavelength studies of AGN, observational astronomy, data analysis, reduction techniques, astronomical surveys, and cosmology. One of my guilty pleasures in astronomy is theoretical work—particularly gravitational field theory. There’s something deeply romantic that always pulls me in. Outside of astrophysics, I’m deeply interested in philosophy, particularly the philosophy of education and science. I see myself as a scientific method enthusiast, always questioning and discussing the way we approach knowledge.

After my PhD, I plan to stay on the dark side of academia—while many dream of early retirement, I dream of being a professor, sharing my passion with fresh minds and convincing those already retired to fund us a little more so that we can get more knowledge about the most mysterious black creatures in the universe.
