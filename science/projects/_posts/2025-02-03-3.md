> Can the simulated data predict how AGN sources would appear with upcoming imaging instruments like LSST? 

The goal of this project is to create a mocked photometric catalog of AGN to simulate the observations that will be conducted by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; e.g., Ivezic et al. 2019). The final aim of the overall project is testing photometric redshift codes for AGN down to LSST-like depth. This is a key point in the LSST AGN Science Collaboration Roadmap. Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a project operating the 8.4-meter Simonyi Survey Telescope built in Chile. LSST aims to conduct a 10-year survey of the Southern Hemisphere sky with the ability to image the entire visible sky every 3 to 4 nights. With its unprecedented scope, the survey will provide crucial advancements in our understanding of galaxies and AGN properties and evolution over cosmic time. This project is in the process, check out the page later for more updates.
