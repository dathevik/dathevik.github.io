Hey! Now the funny and engaging part of the science.

I have an Armenian scientific blog called dathevik, available on both [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dathevik) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@dathevik), where I primarily discuss various scientific topics (not just astronomy!). Through this blog, I was selected as a finalist in Falling Walls. After starting my PhD, I lost my audience, but I'm doing my best to regain it and start uploading more videos. Stay tuned—Dathevik will be back soon. Here is one of my old videos about light polarization.

I am also the author of an Armenian podcast about different professions. You can watch one of the episodes here.

I have given several presentations on astronomy in Armenian schools and other educational initiatives. Here’s one example (again, in Armenian).

I love discussing the importance of science and the scientific method. I’ve had the opportunity to talk about it with adults, teachers, and schoolchildren. Here’s one of my talks in a free-format style, delivered at one of the open-space events.

Aside from making videos and giving presentations, I love organizing stargazing events. In fact, I began my career in astronomy because of my passion for stargazing. I received a telescope as a gift from my father, and that’s how I started my serious relationship with astronomy. My neighborhood knew me as the girl with the telescope because I would be in the nearby park nearly every week, stargazing. In 2022, I was among many other amateur astronomers who helped organize the stargazing event at Starmus VI held in Armenia.
