One of my projects is in collaboration with the [4MOST ChANGES](https://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2020/4MOST2/4MOST_CHANGES.pdf) project. My second project, on the exploration of LAHs, is in collaboration with Emanuele Farina from Gemini Observatory and Eduardo Bañados from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg.

Finally, my third project is going to be delivered to the [LSST AGN Science Collaboration](https://agn.science.lsst.org/sites/default/files/LSST_AGN_SC_Roadmap_260722.pdf) (check the LSST AGN SC roadmap).

Despite my collaborations, I am also a member of [La Sociedad Chilena de Astronomía (SOCHIAS)](https://sochias.cl/) and [Centro de Astrofísica y Tecnologías Afines (CATA)](https://cata.cl/).
