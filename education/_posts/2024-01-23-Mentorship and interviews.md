I have experience as a mentor in various startup initiatives for teenagers, including **Artsakh STEM Fest 2022, Startup Club Armenia, and the SpaceApps Challenge Armenia**. Additionally, I have mentored teachers in diverse aspects of education, such as **remote teaching methods, inclusive education, and science teaching methodologies in schools**, through programs accredited by the **Ministry of Education of the Republic of Armenia and UNICEF**.  

As an **inclusive education specialist**, I mentored **over 60 teachers** across **more than five schools**, assisting them in **establishing inclusive learning environments**. This initiative aimed to ensure that **all schools in Armenia become inclusive**, allowing **children of all abilities to learn together**, thus eliminating the need for separate special education institutions.

In addition, I worked as an **education specialist** in a project dedicated to **organizing remote teaching in Armenia’s rural regions**. Many of these areas face a **severe shortage of students and teachers**, leaving vacancies in subjects like **physics, foreign languages, chemistry, and informatics**. Our team proposed an **innovative solution** to the **Ministry of Education**: hiring **high-performing schools** to provide **remote teaching services** to underserved schools in rural areas. This approach enabled **top educators** to conduct **remote classes**, addressing **knowledge gaps** and ensuring **equal access to quality education**.  
Our team was responsible for **implementing the project, evaluating its quality, and mentoring participating schools** to ensure **smooth and professional remote instruction**. As part of this initiative, I played a key role in **designing institutional work protocols, establishing quality evaluation methods, and mentoring schools** to successfully adopt **remote teaching practices**. Today, **most rural schools in Armenia now have full subject coverage**—either through **local teachers or remote instruction from partner schools**.

Beyond my mentorship work, I have also been an **invited speaker** at **various conferences and workshops** focused on **education**. Here are some of my recorded talks available online:
