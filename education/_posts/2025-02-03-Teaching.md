I began teaching in my second year of undergraduate studies and gained three years of experience in both formal and non-formal education. My first teaching role was at TUMO Center for Creative Technologies, where I worked as a content developer and workshop leader in Robotics. We taught teenagers (ages 12–20) how to build and program LEGO robots. During my time at TUMO, our team participated in the NASA SpaceApps Challenge—and, well, we lost. This remains one of my favorite stories I would love to tell at Fuckup Nights—a truly hilarious experience!
The following year, a team from our Robotics department, including teaching assistants, top students, and volunteers, competed in the Robotics Olympiad in Washington, D.C., under the supervision of my colleague, a highly talented engineer. They won a bronze medal, which was a huge achievement for our department. 

After TUMO, I had a short teaching period at Shirakatsy Scientific Educational Complex, where I taught physics and led the astronomy club.

One of the biggest boosts in my career came when I was selected for a qualification workshop organized by the Ministry of Education of Armenia, in collaboration with UNICEF and Teach for Armenia. This program trained me as part of the first generation of mentors responsible for ensuring a smooth transition to inclusive education across schools in Armenia. This role shaped my ability to organize and lead training sessions, mentor teachers, and gain insight into the institutional structure of education in Armenia.

Shortly after, during the COVID-19 lockdown, Armenia’s education system faced a massive disruption. Along with 20 other teachers, I was selected to organize and implement remote physics lessons. We developed official video-based physics classes, which were later accredited by the Ministry of Education as part of the national curriculum. I also led the scientific subjects team, where we experimented with interdisciplinary video lessons, merging two or three subjects to create fresh, engaging content. We invited guest speakers to discuss the real-world applications of these subjects. Over this period, I created more than 50 video lessons, all available on YouTube.

Here’s an example lesson on photo cameras:

And, of course, one on astronomy (because, obviously, there are more than one astronomy classes, buahahaha):

After completing this project, I joined a team of experts tasked with writing a methodological guide for teachers on inclusive education practices. As a co-author, I contributed to the section on teaching science in an inclusive classroom.

Here is the photo of me with the published book :)
